# sorter
My stash sorter script
# Version 2!
This version is way better than 1 and the code is way more cleaner for further changes. 
## How to use
1. You need some programs for it to work, they are
```
kitty git
```
Kitty is for image view function.
Git is for automatic install.

2. Install the binary from release page and drop it to `~/.local/bin/` or some other bin path.
Use this command for example:
```
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin && mv /path/to/binary ~/.local/bin
```
Replace `/path/to/binary` with the actual path.

3. type the following command to the terminal
```
sorter
```
You're all set!
